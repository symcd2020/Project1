The census education data has:
    "The number of persons age 25 and over who ...
            completed no schooling;
            have a regular high school diploma;
            have a GED or alternative credential;
            hold an Associate's degree;
            hold a Bachelor's degree;
            hold a Master's degree;
            hold a Professional degree;
            hold a Doctoral degree."

The census data on Household Income is the "median household income in the past 12 months."

Null hypothesis: If the Covid-19 pandemic did not lead to an increase the number of individuals aged 25 and over with degrees, then there will be no oberservalbe rise in the proportion of people with some level of education.

Alternate hypothesis: If the Covid-19 pandemic did increase the number of individuals aged 25 and over with degrees, then there will be an observable rise in the proportion of people with some level of education.  

* Things to think about: It takes time to earn a degree. Typical time frames: Associates = 2 years, Bachelors = 4 years, Masters/Professional/Doctoral = 2+ years. So if someone enrolled in some form of higher education in 2020, we may not being seeing their completion in the census data yet. These numbers would be interesting to caclulate for 2023 and 2024, as that would allow time for some to complete the degrees.

A survey by LendingTree (formerly Student Loan Hero), found the below information. https://www.lendingtree.com/student/pandemic-returning-to-school-survey/
    
    LendingTree surveyed over 1,500 Americans between the ages of 18 and 40, and we found that 43% of them are contemplating furthering their education.
    
    Their primary motivation? To increase their income. Plus, many respondents are also interested in changing their careers entirely.

    Key Findings:
        - 43% of adults aged under 40 have considered going back to school amid the pandemic. Those who have student loan debt or who have been laid off or furloughed are especially likely to be thinking about continuing their education.

        - 57% of those surveyed expect that furthering their education would result in a significant salary increase. Almost half (49%) want to start a new career. 

        - Millennials seem to be more drawn to MBA programs, while Gen Zers tend to prefer law school. Women were more likely to consider a medical or nursing degree, but men appeared more focused on business and law.

        - Of those not considering a return to school, 35% said they would reconsider it if they didnâ€™t need to pay for their education, and 34% they would do so if it led to a higher income. 

Things to look at in my data:
    - year-by-year how each education level and it's average household income looks
