# Effects of COVID on the US Median Income

## General Overview

The aim of our project is to uncover, if any, patterns that Covid had on the Median Income of the United States. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between education, marriage status, income level, population density, and other related relationships derived from the data over the years of 2018-2022.

## Overview of Income Analysis Based on Rural vs Urban Populations

For these comparisons, areas were separated by zip code. Zip codes with population <50000 are defined as rural areas and zip codes with populations >50000 are defined as urban areas. 

## Overview of Poverty Rate
This analysis explores the trends in income over the years 2018-2022, focusing on differentiating factors such as Poverty Rate, Household income, Per Capita Income.

## Overview of Income Analysis Based on Marriage Status and Gender for COVID (2018-2022) 

This analysis explores the trends in income over the years 2018-2022, focusing on differentiating factors such as marriage status and gender. The dataset includes information on poverty levels for three distinct groups: Single Females, Single Males, and Married Individuals.

## Overview of Education Levels Impact on Median Income
This analysis explores completed levels of education to see if they had an effect on income.

## Dataset Description

The data used is this study was the U.S. Census data from 2018-2022. The dataset comprises the following columns:

- ?

## Data Visualization for Income Analysis Based on Rural vs Urban Populations

### Per Capita Averages By Year Chart

What the data shows is that the per capita income in both rural and urban areas experienced increases through the pandemic.
Urbanized areas do have slightly higher per capita averages but both have experienced approximately the same growth. 

Before pandemic (2018-2019), urban areas experienced a 4.81% increase in per capita income and rural areas experienced a 3.92% increase in per capita income. 
After pandemic (2021-2022), urban areas experienced a 9.03% increase in per capita income and rural areas experienced an 8.75% increase in per capita income. 

### Population Distribution Chart

What caused the rate on increase in per capita income to nearly double from 2018-2019 to 2021-2022? Is it possibly a shift in the number of people moving from urban to rural areas due to being able to work remotely?

This does not appear to be so, as total numbers of people living in rural areas only sligtly increases from 2020 to 2022.

Other possibilities for this shift could be continued higher education resulting increased salaries or an overall increase in pay rates to encourage employment. This would be an interesting subject for further investigation. 

### Expected Growth Chart

If trends continue at the rate proven by 2018-2022 data, urban per capita income will continue to increase by $2101 per year and rural per capita income will continue to increase by $1750 per year. 
  
## Data Visualization for Poverty Rate
To visually represent the income trends, a bar graph and scatter plots were created for each group.

### Scatter Plots
- **Poverty:** Represented in pink.
- **Poverty Rate:** Represented in blue.
- **Household Income:** Represented in green.
- **Per Capita Income:** Represented in purple.

### Bar Graphs
- **Poverty:** Represented in pink.
- **Household Income:** Represented in green.
- **Per Capita Income:** Represented in purple.
- **Poverty Rate Percentage:** Represented on Orange graph.

## Data Visualization for Marriage Status & Gender
To visually represent the trends, bar graphs and lines charts were created.

### Scatter Plots
To visually represent the income trends, a bar graph and scatter plot with regression lines were created for each group.

- **Female:** Represented in pink.
- **Male:** Represented in blue.
- **Married:** Represented in orange.

### Regression Lines

Each scatter plot is accompanied by a regression line that indicates the general trend over the years.

## Data Visualization for Education
To visually represent the education trends, bar graphs and lines charts were created.

### Bar Graph 1
Shows the average number of completions for each level of education. From this we can see that High School and Bachelors degrees have the largest number of completions. From this view, it looks like Associates, Bachelors, and Masters completions are increasing over the years. Next we will look closer at these three levels of education. 
- **No Education:** Represented in blue.
- **High School Education:** Represented in orange.
- **GED:** Represented in green.
- **Associates:** Represented in red.
- **Bachelors:** Represented in purple.
- **Masters:** Represented in brown.
- **Professional:** Represented in pink.
- **Doctorate:** Represented in grey.

### Line Chart
Shows the TOTAL number of completions for Associates, Bachelors, and Masters education levels. From this view, we can see that the overall total number of completions for each degree type is increasing, but is it increasing more in the year post covid (2020)? Next, we will examine the increases more closely.
- **Associates:** Represented in blue.
- **Bachelors:** Represented in orange.
- **Masters:** Represented in green.

### Bar Graph 2
Shows the total number of NEW completions for Associates, Bachelors, and Masters education levels in each year. This bar graph shows only the new completed degrees each year. The data actually shows that less people completed degrees between 2021 and 2022, than in prior years. While the overall total of completions of education levels have not stopped increasing, the yearly completion amount has decreased.
- **Associates:** Represented in blue.
- **Bachelors:** Represented in orange.
- **Masters:** Represented in green.

## Key Findings

### 1. Lori

### 2. Lori 2 if needed

### 3. Poverty Rate Over Time

- **Analysis:** The scatter plots and bar graphs show a consistent decline, indicating a decreasing trend in poverty levels from 2018 to 2022.

### 4. Poverty Levels Over Time

- **Single Female:** The scatter plot and regression line for poverty among females show a consistent decline, indicating a decreasing trend in poverty levels from 2018 to 2022.

- **Single Male:** The scatter plot and regression line for poverty among males exhibit a similar decreasing trend, signifying a reduction in poverty levels over the analyzed years.

- **Married:** The scatter plot and regression line for poverty among families also demonstrate a declining trend, suggesting an overall improvement in economic conditions for families.

### 5. Relative Trends
**Females vs. Males:** While both Single Females and Single Males show decreasing trends, it appears that poverty among females is consistently higher than among males.

**Families vs. Individuals:** Married Individuals exhibit a similar trend to Single Females and Single Males, indicating that economic conditions for families follow a comparable pattern to those of individuals.

### 6. Completed Levels of Education Over Time

- **Limitations:** The data used only includes data on those aged 25 and up. The data used only includes data on those who have completed the education, not currently enrolled. The years of data used in this study (2018-2022). As we know, it takes time to complete a degree. Associates take approximately 2 years. Bachelors take approximately 4 years. Masters take approximately 2+ years depending on the program of study.
  
-  **Analysis:** Based on the available data, the Covid-19 pandemic did not lead to an increase in the number of individuals aged 25 and over with degrees. There was no observable increased rise in the proportion of people with some level of education over the typical year-to-year completion rates. The data shows that there was in fact a decrease in the number of completed levels of education from 2021-2022. 



## Conclusion

The analysis suggests an overall positive trend in income, with decreasing poverty levels across all groups from 2018 to 2022. The visualizations provide insights into the relative differences in poverty levels based on both gender and family status.
