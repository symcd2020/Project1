# Income Analysis Based on Marriage Status and Gender for COVID (2018-2022)

## Overview

This analysis explores the trends in income over the years 2018-2022, focusing on differentiating factors such as marriage status and gender. The dataset includes information on poverty levels for three distinct groups: Single Females, Single Males, and Married Individuals.

The aim of our project is to uncover, if any, patterns that Covid had on the Median Income of the United States. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between education, marriage status, income level, population density, and other related relationships derived from the data over the years of 2018-2022.

- **Year:** The years ranging from 2018 to 2022.
- **poverty_female:** Poverty levels for single females.

## Data Visualization

To visually represent the income trends, a bar graph and scatter plot with regression lines were created for each group.

### Scatter Plots

## Key Findings

### 1. Poverty Levels Over Time

- **Single Female:** The scatter plot and regression line for poverty among females show a consistent decline, indicating a decreasing trend in poverty levels from 2018 to 2022.

- **Single Male:** The scatter plot and regression line for poverty among males exhibit a similar decreasing trend, signifying a reduction in poverty levels over the analyzed years.

- **Married:** The scatter plot and regression line for poverty among families also demonstrate a declining trend, suggesting an overall improvement in economic conditions for families.

### 2. Relative Trends
**Females vs. Males:** While both Single Females and Single Males show decreasing trends, it appears that poverty among females is consistently higher than among males.

**Families vs. Individuals:** Married Individuals exhibit a similar trend to Single Females and Single Males, indicating that economic conditions for families follow a comparable pattern to those of individuals.

### 10. Completed Levels of Education Over Time

## Conclusion

The analysis suggests an overall positive trend in income, with decreasing poverty levels across all groups from 2018 to 2022. The visualizations provide insights into the relative differences in poverty levels based on both gender and family status.

This information can be valuable for policymakers, researchers, and organizations aiming to address economic disparities and formulate targeted interventions.
